# ❤️ Heart Disease Prediction Using Machine Learning  

## 📌 Overview  
This project predicts the likelihood of a person having **heart disease** based on medical attributes using **Machine Learning**.  
It aims to provide a quick and efficient tool for **health risk assessment** that can assist doctors, researchers, and individuals in early diagnosis and prevention.  

---

## 🚀 Features  
- Data preprocessing & exploratory data analysis (EDA)  
- Machine Learning model training & evaluation  
- User-friendly web app interface using **Streamlit**  
- Predicts heart disease risk based on input parameters  

---

## 📂 Dataset  
The dataset used is from the **UCI Machine Learning Repository** (Heart Disease Dataset).  
It includes medical attributes such as:  

- **Age** – Patient’s age  
- **Sex** – Male/Female  
- **Chest Pain Type (cp)** – 4 types of chest pain  
- **Resting Blood Pressure (trestbps)**  
- **Cholesterol (chol)**  
- **Fasting Blood Sugar (fbs)**  
- **Resting ECG (restecg)**  
- **Max Heart Rate Achieved (thalach)**  
- **Exercise Induced Angina (exang)**  
- **Oldpeak** – ST depression induced by exercise  
- **Slope of Peak Exercise ST Segment (slope)**  
- **Number of Major Vessels (ca)**  
- **Thalassemia (thal)**  
- **Target** – 1 = Heart Disease, 0 = No Heart Disease

## 🛠️ Tech Stack  
- **Python** (pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn)  
- **Machine Learning** – Logistic Regression / Random Forest / SVM  
- **Streamlit** – Web app deployment  
- **GitHub** – Version control & portfolio showcase  

---

## 📊 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
Some insights found during analysis:  
- Age and cholesterol are strong indicators of heart disease.  
- Maximum records belong to **patients between 40-60 years**.  
- Patients with **exercise-induced angina** are more likely to have heart disease.  

---

## 🎯 Results  
- Achieved **~85% accuracy** (depending on ML model used).  
- Logistic Regression & Random Forest performed the best.
